Material site template for Jekyll
=================================

This is a site template for [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) which lets you use the new [Google Material Design](http://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/) in your favorite static site generator.

**Live demo:** https://vinyanalista.github.io/material-jekyll

**Download:** [as a ZIP file](https://github.com/vinyanalista/material-jekyll/archive/master.zip)

It is built on top of the [Jekyll's default site template](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/tree/v2.5.3/lib/site_template) and the following excelent libraries:

- [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) (MIT License)
- [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) (MIT License)
- [Material Design for Bootstrap](http://fezvrasta.github.io/bootstrap-material-design/) (MIT License)
- [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io) (SIL OFL 1.1 and MIT License)

This template is out of the box compatible with [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) (in fact, the live demo itself is hosted on GitHub Pages). The only [Jekyll plugin](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/plugins/) it uses is the [Jekyll Sitemap Generator Plugin](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-sitemap), which is one of the [plugins supported by GitHub Pages](https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-plugins-with-github-pages/).

To get a site based on this template up and running, just [install Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/), download and extract the template and then, from the command line, run:

```
$ bundle
$ jekyll serve
```

Now browse to [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000) and you should see it live (just like [this](https://vinyanalista.github.io/material-jekyll)).

You may also [fork this template's repository](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) to use it as a starting point for your own site. That way, you may update your code with eventual updates to the original template.

Enjoy!
